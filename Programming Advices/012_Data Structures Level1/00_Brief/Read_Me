1- Program = Algorithms + Data Structure.

2- Heterogenous means Different Types
   Homogenous means Same Types
   Linear Data Structure means that data is in sequence order

3- What Affects Program Speed?
   1- Hardware (CPU, RAM, OS) --> Performance
   2- Algorithm: ---------------> Complexity
       1- Time
       2- Space
    

4 - What affects Algorithm?
