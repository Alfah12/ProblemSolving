1- Program = Algorithms + Data Structure.

2- Heterogenous means Different Types
   Homogenous means Same Types
   Linear Data Structure means that data is in sequence order

3- What Affects Program Speed?
   1- Hardware (CPU, RAM, OS) --> Performance
   2- Algorithm: ---------------> Complexity
       1- Time
       2- Space
    
4 - What affects Algorithm?
    1- Time
    2- Space
    
5- Performance has to do with?
    Hardware , OS

6- Complexity has to do with?
    Time Complexity
    Space Complexity
    
7-  Big O, also known as Big O notation, represents an algorithm's worst-case complexity.
8-  Big O uses algebraic terms to describe the complexity of an algorithm.
9-  Big O describes the relationship between Input Size and Time/Spcase
10- Big O does not tell you the exact time your algorithm's runtime is.
