1- Program = Algorithms + Data Structure.

2- Heterogenous means Different Types
   Homogenous means Same Types
   Linear Data Structure means that data is in sequence order

3- What Affects Program Speed?
   1- Hardware (CPU, RAM, OS) --> Performance
   2- Algorithm: ---------------> Complexity
       1- Time
       2- Space
    
4 - What affects Algorithm?
    1- Time
    2- Space
    
5- Performance has to do with?
    Hardware , OS

6- Complexity has to do with?
    Time Complexity
    Space Complexity
    
7-  Big O, also known as Big O notation, represents an algorithm's worst-case complexity.
    بيعطيك علاقة مابين عدد الانبوتس والتايم اللي بدو ياخده --> انتبه هو مابيعطيك سبيسيفيك تايم
    Big O uses algebraic terms to describe the complexity of an algorithm.
    Big O describes the relationship between Input Size and Time/Spcase
    Big O does not tell you the exact time your algorithm's runtime is.

8- Big O Types:

    1- O(1) Constant Time Function:
         ثابت
         O(1) is not affected by Input Size, so it always takes the same time.
         O(1) is the fastest notation, which means that your algorithm is excellent.
      
    2- O(n) is a linear time function:
         كل مابزيد خطوة بزيد خطوةفي الوقت
         O(n) is affected by Input Size Linearly.
    
    3- O(n^2) is Quadratic Time Function:
         كل مابزيد خطوة بزيد ضعفها في الوقت
    
    4- O(log n)
       Log means that the number of iterations in the loop is always less than n
       Log2 always half itself.
